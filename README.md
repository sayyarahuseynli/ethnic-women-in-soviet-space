# ethnic-women-in-soviet-space
“Ethnic Women in Soviet Space” is a repository dedicated to the portrayal of women from 30 ethnic groups within the early Soviet Union. “Труженица Востока” "Truzhenit︠s︡a Vostoka" journal published between 1928-20 is the primary source. I use topic modeling to identify how women were used as forces to propel the revolutionary agenda.
